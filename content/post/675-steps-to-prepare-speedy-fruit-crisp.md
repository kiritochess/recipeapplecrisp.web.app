Cobblers have a softer biscuit-like topping and texture, while crumbles and crisps have a crunchy, buttery, streusel-like topping that provides a contrast to the soft fruit in the filling. First up, apples are combined with maple syrup instead of sugar in this fruit crisp to impart sweet, but not too sweet, distinctive flavor. My favorite summer dessert is the simplest one: a fruit crisp. A layer of jammy, sweet-tart fruit topped with crunchy, chewy streusel topping-it&#39;s addictive. Apple crisp is the carefree, easy-breezy cousin of apple pie.
