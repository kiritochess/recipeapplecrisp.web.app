recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the apples under room temperature water and pat them dry with a clean towel. Place the pop sticks into the apples and into the core."
- "Chop the oreos, kitkat, and set them on a plate. You could mix these ingredients, but I separated mine. The shredded coconut as well."
- "Using a microwave safe dish, heat your chosen chocolate for 30 seconds, stir using a wooden spatula, then continue to melt in 10 second intervals and stirring in between until completely melted. Be careful, do not overdo this step or your chocolate will be ruined."
- "Dip the apples into the chocolate, you can cover the whole apple or only half of it. Its upto how you like it. I did the whole apple."
- "Using the wooden spatula, pat the apple gently and remove any excess chocolate. If you skip this step, the chocolate will drain to the bottom of the plate and the decoration won&#39;t stick to it either"
- "Hold your apple side ways and using your hand, put the shredded coconut on it, or oreo, or kitkat, press gently as you turn it. I did 50/50 on mine."
- "Repeat the process with all the apples. There are no rules on how you want to decorate your apples. You can use anything you like including nuts or pieces of leftover cookies!"
