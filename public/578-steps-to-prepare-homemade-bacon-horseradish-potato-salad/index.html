<p>This potato salad is made with red, white and blue potatoes, bleu cheese, creamy greek yogurt and horseradish dressing and red peppers and bacon. It makes a patriotic (and crazy yummy) barbecue side dish for Memorial Day or the Fourth of July, or all summer long. This potato salad with horseradish follows the same idea, replacing the vinegar with a bright lemon-scallion-anchovy dressing and adding parsley and yellow peppers for some textural variation.</p>

<li>When potatoes are cold through and through, remove the plastic wrap and add the crumbled bacon (reserving 2 tablespoons for garnish), chopped hard boiled egg, mayo, horseradish, and thinly sliced onion greens (reserving 2 tablespoons for garnish). Gently toss to combine and adjust taste to suit. Cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 2 hour, but preferably overnight before serving.
