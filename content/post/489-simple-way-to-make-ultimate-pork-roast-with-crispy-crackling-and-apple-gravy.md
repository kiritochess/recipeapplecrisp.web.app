Return the meat to the tray and put it back into the oven, uncovered. Turn the heat up to 400F. Roast an additional 1 hour or until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 160 F and the skin is a dark, crispy shell. Remove the roast from the oven and let rest, uncovered, for 20 minutes."
- "Spoon the film of excess oil from the top of the pot of drippings. Put the pot on medium heat and bring to a simmer. Make a slurry by mixing cornstarch with 1/4 cup water. Whisk the slurry into the drippings. Keep whisking until it thickens into a gravy. Add extra salt and pepper as needed and serve beside the pork."
