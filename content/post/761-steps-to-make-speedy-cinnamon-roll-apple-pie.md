A newer, Cinnabon version of apple pie that will make you forget you had a family recipe. Mini cinnamon rolls form the incredible (and incredibly beautiful) top crust on this roasted caramel apple pie. Real talk: Pie crust is the most difficult part of making a pie. Achieving a buttery, flaky consistency without going too far past golden brown is not. Halving and rolling out the cinnamon buns ensures that they&#39;ll stay thin and crisp like a pie crust would, rather than rising into actual cinnamon buns.
