recipeingredient:
- "200 g plain flour"
- "50 g icing sugar"
- "125 g butter"
- "1 egg yolk"
- "900 g crisp sharp dessert apples about 6 large"
- "150 ml single cream"
- "1 large egg"
- "35 g caster sugar"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "3 tbsp apricot jam to glaze"
recipeinstructions:
- "To make the pastry blitz the flour, icing sugar and butter in a food processor, or rub with your fingertips, until you have a mixture that looks like breadcrumbs. Stir in the egg yolk and about 2 tbsp cold water and bring together to make a dough. Don&#39;t add too much water. Wrap in plastic film and chill in the fridge for 25 minutes."
- "Roll the chilled pastry out thinly and use it to line a 23cm loose-based tart tin. Prick the base with a fork and chill again for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180C/Gas 4. Line the pastry case with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. You can  use ordinary dried beans if you don&#39;t have special baking beans (which are ceramic), and I also have a friend who uses loose change."
- "Bake for 20 minutes, then remove the baking beans and paper and place back in the oven. You can brush the pastry with egg white at this stage to make it even more safely sealed. Cook for another 5 minutes or so until completely dried out. Allow the pastry to cool."
- "Peel and core the apples, I used a bowl of lemon water to keep them from going brown. Then slice very thinly and arrange in regular concentric circles (quite difficult) in the cooled pastry case."
- "Mix together the cream, egg, sugar and vanilla extract, and pour into the pastry case. Bake for 35 minutes, still at 180C/Gas 4 until the custard is just set and the apples cooked."
- "Remove the tart from the oven and while hot brush with warmed apricot jam for a shiny, golden finish. Serve warm with vanilla cream or ice cream."
