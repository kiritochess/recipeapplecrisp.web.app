recipeingredient:
- "250 grams Strong bread flour"
- "30 grams Cake flour"
- "1 1/2 tsp Dry yeast"
- "25 grams Granulated sugar"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "15 grams Butter"
- "170 ml Lukewarm water"
- "1/2 Apple"
- "2 tbsp Honey"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice the apple into eight wedges and then into quarter-rounds. Place slices in a microwave-safe container and pour 1 tablespoon of honey over them. Microwave for 2 minutes first with plastic wrap, and then for another minute without wrap. Let cool."
- "In a bowl, combine the bread flour, cake flour, dry yeast, granulated sugar, salt (making sure it&#39;s not next to the yeast), and pour the lukewarm water over the yeast. Mix it up a little and blend in the butter. Knead for about 15 minutes until smooth."
- "Once the kneading is done, roll up the dough as if tucking the sides into the bottom. Place the dough in a bowl covered with thinly spread oil (not listed in ingredients) and cover with a plastic wrap or a slightly dampened kitchen towel. Let it rise for 40 to 60 minutes by leaving it in a warm room, or by using the bread-rising of your microwave. (This picture shows the dough before rising.)"
- "Once the rising is done, the dough should have risen to about twice its previous size, and shouldn&#39;t bounce back when pushed down with a finger. Take it out from the bowl and tap lightly to let the gas escape. Roll it up again, cover with plastic wrap or a dampened, tightly wrung out towel and let rest for about 10 minutes."
- "Roll out the dough into a circle of about 30 cm in diameter, and spread 1 tablespoon of honey, leaving about 2 cm of space near the edges. Arrange the apples over honey."
- "Fold in from all four sides, making sure the seams are completely sealed."
- "Fold in the top and bottom sides, rotate 90 degrees, and repeat the same folding process. With the seam facing down, cut the dough into three."
- "Place the three pieces of dough in a mold with the cross-sections facing up. Cover with a plastic wrap or a tightly wrung out kitchen towel and let rise a second time for about 20 to 30 minutes."
- "Once the dough has risen, preheat the oven to 190℃ and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes."
- "It&#39;s done. The bread has risen quite a lot."
- "Tear a piece apart, and you&#39;ll see how fluffy and moist it is."
