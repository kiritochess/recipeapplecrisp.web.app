recipeinstructions:
- "Place chicken in the gallon bag and pour dressing into the bag.  If you feel like you need more dressing to effectively coat the chicken, do so.

- "combine diced apples and shredded cheese in a small bowl and set aside."
- "place bread crumbs in a dish - you will be using this to coat the chicken so plan accordingly"
- "place your baking dish, lined with foil or parchment paper, beside the &#34;breading&#34; station.  Place a filet knife beside the breading station and place toothpicks on the baking dish.  Now you should have everything ready before touching raw chicken!"
- "remove chicken from the fridge; remove chicken from the bag and place each breast in the bread crumbs; coat each breast with crumbs"
- "place breaded chicken on baking pan; slice each breast in half lengthwise ( like a hot dog bun) and stuff with apple and Gouda mixture"
- "&#34;seal&#34; the breast with toothpicks; bake for 30 minutes or until done"
- "If you have leftover apple and gouda , you can place the mixture on top of the breasts so it will cook and melt over the chicken"
