<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-honey-apple-bread">The ingredients needed to make Honey Apple Bread:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get 250 grams Strong bread flour</li>
<li>Make ready 30 grams Cake flour</li>
<li>Make ready 1 1/2 tsp Dry yeast</li>

<li>Make ready 1/2 Apple</li>
<li>Take 2 tbsp Honey</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-honey-apple-bread">Instructions to make Honey Apple Bread:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Slice the apple into eight wedges and then into quarter-rounds. Place slices in a microwave-safe container and pour 1 tablespoon of honey over them. Microwave for 2 minutes first with plastic wrap, and then for another minute without wrap. Let cool.</li>
<li>In a bowl, combine the bread flour, cake flour, dry yeast, granulated sugar, salt (making sure it's not next to the yeast), and pour the lukewarm water over the yeast. Mix it up a little and blend in the butter. Knead for about 15 minutes until smooth.</li>
<li>Once the kneading is done, roll up the dough as if tucking the sides into the bottom. Place the dough in a bowl covered with thinly spread oil (not listed in ingredients) and cover with a plastic wrap or a slightly dampened kitchen towel. Let it rise for 40 to 60 minutes by leaving it in a warm room, or by using the bread-rising of your microwave. (This picture shows the dough before rising.)</li>
<li>Once the rising is done, the dough should have risen to about twice its previous size, and shouldn't bounce back when pushed down with a finger. Take it out from the bowl and tap lightly to let the gas escape. Roll it up again, cover with plastic wrap or a dampened, tightly wrung out towel and let rest for about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Roll out the dough into a circle of about 30 cm in diameter, and spread 1 tablespoon of honey, leaving about 2 cm of space near the edges. Arrange the apples over honey.</li>
<li>Fold in from all four sides, making sure the seams are completely sealed.</li>
<li>Fold in the top and bottom sides, rotate 90 degrees, and repeat the same folding process. With the seam facing down, cut the dough into three.</li>
<li>Place the three pieces of dough in a mold with the cross-sections facing up. Cover with a plastic wrap or a tightly wrung out kitchen towel and let rise a second time for about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Once the dough has risen, preheat the oven to 190â„ƒ and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
<li>It's done. The bread has risen quite a lot.</li>
<li>Tear a piece apart, and you'll see how fluffy and moist it is.</li>
