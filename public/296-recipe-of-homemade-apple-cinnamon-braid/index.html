<h5 id="instructions-to-make-apple-cinnamon-braid">Instructions to make Apple Cinnamon Braid:</h5>
<ol>
<li>You will need:</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 350°F</li>
<li>Peel the apple's, cut in half and de-seed. Then cut into small pieces.</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, toss the apple's with the cinnamon, sugar, and lemon juice until well coated.</li>
<li>Put in a baking dish and bake for 18 minutes.  Once done, remove from oven and set aside.</li>
<li>While the filling is baking- start the Dough Braid. In a large mixing bowl sift together the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt.</li>
<li>In another bowl, mix together the food coloring and water, then add the oil. The food coloring is optional. <strong>Note</strong> to make this festive for autumn for Halloween or Autumn mix food coloring to make the dough orange!</li>
<li>Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix on medium-high speed for about 5 minutes.</li>

<li>Lightly flour your surface and knead the dough to get a smoother texture.</li>
<li>On the baking sheet, or on a well floured surface roll the dough out length wise into a long rectangle. I recommend doing this on the baking sheet because transferring of the braid will be pretty complicated.</li>
<li>Down the length of the dough, cut one inch strips on both sides,  leaving a gap of at least 3 inches in the middle un-cut.</li>
<li>Spread your filling down the center evenly.</li>
<li>Starting at the top, alternately crisscross the cut peices over top of the filling, pinching at the sides to secure it.</li>
<li>Transfer the braid (if needed) to your baking sheet and bake in the oven for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>While this is baking make the Glaze. Sift together the powdered sugar and nutmeg. Then add in the milk and teaspoon of vanilla extract and stir well.</li>
<li>Crush the nuts using a mortar and pestle</li>
